# This News project was my first experience working with TypeScript. I learned how to use types to improve code reliability and maintainability while building a Vue 3 application.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Koteykee/VuePosts
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
3. Run application
```sh
npm run dev
```
Done! 😄
